Below the link, write 1-2 sentences that describe why your use demonstrates mastery and appropriate use of that requirement. For example, 
"I created a matrix variable (vector of vector of pixels) to represent an image because images are two-dimensional grids of Red-Green-Blue
pixel components."

### input/output

>[main.cpp lines 33-34] (/main.cpp#L33)
I wrote this code because I needed to know whether or not the user wanted to continue or quit, therefore needing direct
interaction with them.

### control flow
>[main.cpp lines 26-29] (/main.cpp#L26)
   [main.cpp lines 56-59] (/main.cpp#L56)
I used these two if statements because I wanted to make sure that the user didn't try to input any invalid text, and so they'd have the 
opportunity to correct it if it was a typo.

>[main.cpp lines 60-63] (/main.cpp#L60)
I placed this else statement here because I didn't want the program to use invalid text, and this way it will only run if it's valid.

### iteration
>[main.cpp lines 22-37] (/main.cpp#L22)
I used this dowhile because I needed it to keep prompting the user for input as many times as they wished to continue for.
